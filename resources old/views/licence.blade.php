                        preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your
                        overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you
                        from saving customized settings like login information. Browser manufacturers provide help pages
                        relating to cookie management in their products.</p>
